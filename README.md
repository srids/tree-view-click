# tree-view-open path


### P.S.

This package is a copy from [dbclick-tree-view](https://atom.io/packages/dbclick-tree-view), I added some enhancement to it, but I can not contact with the author to merge the pr in github. So I forked it and publish here.

By default, the atom tree-view for browsing files/directories will open a file or collapse / expand a directory listing just by single-clicking on the entry.

This package allows the user to choose single or double click on a file to open it, or on a directory to expand/collapse it. This effectively turns a single-click into just selecting the item clicked on, which is the default behavior in most editors.

Tips: if `Allow Pending Pane Items` in `Settings/Core` is set to `false` and `Enable on file` of this package setting is set to `false`, single click on file will open the file.

### Settings

- `Enable On File`: Double click on a file to open/close it, otherwise single click to do it.

- `Enable On Folder`: Double click on a folder to expand/collapse it, otherwise single click to do it.

### Change log

- 0.1.0 init
